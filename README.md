## Flask and ML-based Web Application for Disease Prediction

 *This repository contains a Flask and machine learning-based web application that predicts the possibility of multiple diseases. It leverages a trained machine learning model to provide accurate predictions based on input data.*

## Features
 - Predicts the possibility of multiple diseases based on input data.
 - User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
 - Efficient and accurate machine learning model.
 - Easy to deploy and run.

## Installation

**To run this application locally, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-ml-disease-prediction.git
cd flask-ml-disease-prediction
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
**The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000 in your browser.**

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser by visiting http://localhost:5000.

2. Fill in the necessary information in the input fields provided.

3. Click the **"Predict"** button to obtain the prediction for the possibility of diseases.

4. The application will display the predicted diseases along with their corresponding probabilities.

## Technology Stack
The following technologies and libraries were used to develop this application:

- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Machine Learning (ML) libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Dataset
The application employs a carefully curated dataset that was used to train the machine learning model. The dataset contains relevant features and labeled instances of various diseases.

## Model Training
The machine learning model was trained on the provided dataset using appropriate algorithms and techniques. The training process involved feature engineering, model selection, and performance optimization.
